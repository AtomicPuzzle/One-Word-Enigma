# One-Word-Enigma
A text-based Java game I made in jGrasp for my first semester of computer science. 


There are five levels with 5 random riddles on each. The answers are only one word. 
The player gets three tries on each level. 

If you get to the end there is a bonus riddle!

Have fun playing!
